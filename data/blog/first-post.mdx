Hey guys, Most of you might not know who I am... I am just a first year Btech computer science student who is very passionate about <b>coding</b>. I love reading,writing poems and short rhymes. I am very much active in sports like football,swimming,cricket and badminton. I love <b>music</b>. You can check out my [github](https://github.com/iammarco11) profile. 

I have used markdown and html for this blog post, so thought I would tag them.

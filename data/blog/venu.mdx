## Got hired at Venu!!

It has been a while since I blogged and I am super thrilled to say that I would be working at a YC funded startup called [Venu](https://www.venu3d.com/) as a VR developer. I worked with the virtualworldarcade team for like a month and helped with some avatar menu customisation setup on a game called [Re-O-Ri](https://store.steampowered.com/app/958750/ReORi/). Yesterday was my ramp up and I am excited and looking forward to this new chapter of my life.

You all can email me at akshay@venu3d.com. Flexing my separate inbox :P
